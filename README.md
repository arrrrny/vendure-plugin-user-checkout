# Vendure plugin template

1. Copy this directory and rename to `vendure-plugin-YOUR-PLUGIN-NAME`
2. Update the `name` and `description` field in `package.json`
4. Update this Readme: What does the plugin do? How can someone use your plugin in their project?
5. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
6. Run `npm run start` to start the server

The admin is now available at `http://localhost:3050/admin`. Login with _superadmin/superadmin_

The shop GraphQL `http://localhost:3050/shop-api`. Here you can test your custom GraphQL query:
```graphql
{
  exampleQuery
}
```

## Testing

1. Run `npm run test` to run the e2e test.
2. Don't forget to implement your own!

## Publishing to NPM

2. `npm run build`

That's it!
